<p>That message was from Knightley.  Sitting here creating my card for you, my kitten helps me realize just how attentive and patient you always were.  You were happy to be our mother, and you passed your joy to us.  I love you so much, and I wish I could be there to celebrate with you today.</p>
<p>You are such a happy, sunny person.  I tried to find a poem by a famous poet to put in your card, but none of those poets seemed to have a mother as sprightly and gleeful as you, so I had to abandon that enterprise.  However, I found some animal photos which better remind me of our childhood and your continuing love for me and Hillary.</p>
